    <h2>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>What is Net Worth?</h3>
    <p>
      A net worth amount is how much money you are actually having. Its formula is very simple:<br />
      <code>Net Worth = all assets - all liabilities</code><br /><br /> Let's say you have $10,000 cash in your bank account, and have $2,000 in your credit card, your net worth at this point in time is $8,000.
    </p>
    <h3>Why should I care about realtime Net Worth?</h3>
    <p>
      You might only know an estimated net worth number. With this service, you would know that amount in realtime. Here are the advantages:
      <ol>
        <li>Instantly know if a big spending occurred that you might not know about</li>
        <li>Know when you can retire based on your historical data</li>
      </ol>
    </p>


    <h3>Can you withdrawal money from my bank account?</h3>
    <p>
      By law we can't do that and with our technical implementation, we only have access to read your account balance and transactions. We don't sell your financial data. We make money by helping you host this awesome open source software that we have created.
    </p>

    <h3>Why do you guys open source your software? What is open source?</h3>
    <p>
      Open source software allows anyone to view the source code and makes changes to it in anyway they want. They can modify it to make it better and make a new product from it. We are big believer in open source software. In fact the Net Worth project is
      all built from using other open source software. We use the simple MIT license so you can actually just copy the software and make a new company out of it.
    </p>

    <h3>How do you make money if you guys are giving away your source code for free?</h3>
    <p>
      Many great companies have done this before us, Wordpress, Reddit, Docker, etc are all open source projects. We make money by charging our customers a small fees to help them host the software. The software is free but the infrastructure such as server
      and database are not free. We also provide paying customers with faster technical support.
